## Project 01 - Covid Map Dashboard
This is a part of [#50reactproject](https://50reactprojects.com) -- a series of project briefs and wireframes for learning React.

## Brief
Create an app that helps you keep track of things you still need to do.

## Level 1
The goal of a todo list is to be able to add items and check them off once they are complete. This helps keep track of what we still need to do and what we already have done.

Create an app that allows you to add items to a list and mark them as done.

## Level 2
Soemtimes it's useful to group similar items together. 

Add support for categories to your application. Users should be able to filter todo items by category.

## Level 3
Add the ability to share the list with another person to hold yourself accountable.

## User Stories
As a user, I can
- [X] Read a list of tasks
- [X] Add a task
- [X] Mark any task as completed
- [ ] Delete any task
- [ ] Edit any Task
- [ ] View a specific subset of tasks: All tasks, only the active task, or only completed tasks
- [ ] View tasks by category
- [ ] Share my todo list with someone else

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
